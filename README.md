### Important!!
This is *heavily inspired* (a lot of part is copy-pasted) from [ZaneyOS](https://gitlab.com/Zaney/zaneyos) by [Tyler](https://gitlab.com/Zaney).
However, unlike Zaneyos, *I do not use Home-manager* to manage dotfiles. My dotfiles can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/arjav0703/dots).
